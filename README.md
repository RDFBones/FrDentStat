## Extension "FrDentStat" for RDFBones-O
This is an RDFBones extension for the documentation of the dental status of human skeletons. FrDentStat comprises the degree and localization of caries lesions, the degree of dental calculus, tooth abrasion, linear enamel hypoplasia as well as periodontosis and periodontitis. The extension is based on the data entry form for teeth and jaw that is used at the department of Biological Anthropology Freiburg. Due to repatriation claims, the dental status of several skulls from the Alexander Ecker Collection was recorded. The research project "Human Skeletal Collections" aims at developing a software to digitize and archive these data and make them accessible for future research.For further information on the Alexander Ecker Collection cf. Kästner _et al._ 2011.

The degree of tooth abrasion is scored according to Herrmann _et al._ 1990. Linear enamel hypoplasia, dental calculus, periodontosis and periodontitis are scored according to Schultz 1988. For the documentation of the degree and localization of caries, the internal standards of the Biological Anthropology Freiburg are used.

## Wiki index
The FrDentStat wiki is accessible from: https://github.com/RDFBones/FrDentStat/wiki. The structure of the FrDentStat ontology is based on the concept of RDFBones extensions first elaborated in the extension FrSexEst. Thus, this wiki is shorter than the [FrSexEst wiki](https://github.com/RDFBones/FrSexEst/wiki) and focuses more on the anthropological workflow. Readers interested in developing their own extension should rather have a look at the [FrSexEst wiki](https://github.com/RDFBones/FrSexEst/wiki) which discusses some technical as well as philosophical/ontological issues related to extension writing. This wiki covers the following topics:
* [Anthropological background](https://github.com/RDFBones/FrDentStat/wiki/Anthropological-background)
* [General structure of FrCranMetr](https://github.com/RDFBones/FrDentStat/wiki/General-structure-of-FrDentStat)
